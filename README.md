## Hey 👋, I'm Isshiki修 / Yan XIA / 夏彦! 

I am an incoming CS PhD at UT Austin, and I earned my bachelor’s degree from Zhejiang University in 2025.

I like to write down my study notes. You can find most of the notes in [my digital notebook (Chinese)](https://note.isshikih.top).

In addition, I am a beginning researcher focusing on computer vision and digital humans. For more information, please visit [my academic homepage](https://scholar.isshikih.top).
